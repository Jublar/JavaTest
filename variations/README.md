# Kenect Spring Test Project

### Challenge
Update the findVariations method in Variations to return a new array that is the result of every possible combination from the input array. You can add/update any method as you deem necessary.

For example:

* given the input array of ["a", "b"] the resultant array would be ["a", "ab", "b", "ba"]
* given the input array of ["a", "b", "c"] the resultant array would be ["a", "ab", "ac", "abc", "acb", "b", "ba", ....]

Your console output should be the resultant array.


### What we are looking for
Please use good programming patterns. We are looking for good separation of concerns, OOP principles, and an efficient solution. Really, just good code.

##### Tests:
* Please include unit tests for your code.
