# Kenect Spring Test Project

### Challenge
We have created an empty runnable Spring Boot application. Your task is to create a simple `Contact Management` system. Using RESTful endpoints, you should create a complete application that can create, read, update, and delete contacts.

This application utilizes a H2 database so you should be able to persist contacts. It is configured to persist the database to a file in `./data/kenect-spring-test1-db`. Please make sure that you include the generated database when you commit your code.

It is up to you as to how you structure your contact data. Think about real world examples of how a user might need to save and manage their contacts.

This project is configured with several Spring technologies. Feel free to add more or remove any that you would like.

### Definition
Contact: Just like you would find in your phone or address book. You need to store information pertinent to a person. What you store, how you store it, and why is up to you. Think about real-world scenarios and include information pertinent to those scenarios.

### What we are looking for
Please use good programming patterns. We are looking for good separation of concerns, OOP principles, structure and relationships of your data. Really, just good code.

##### Tests:
* Please include unit tests for your code.
